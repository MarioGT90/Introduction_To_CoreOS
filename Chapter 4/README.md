## Chapter 4: Launching a development CoreOS Cluster* Chapter 4 Introduction Slide:  In this chapter, we will boot a development CoreOS cluster, deploy our first service, experiment with CoreOS tools fleet & etcd, and finally learn how to troubleshoot container and OS issues.###  0401 Installing dependencies (Docker, Vagrant, fleetctl)* (Chapter 4 Intro Slide) In this video tutorial series, I will be using my Apple computer.  If you also have an Apple computer, then you should be able to follow right along with all of the examples.  For those of you running Linux or Unix based operating systems, the demonstrated content should be very similar for your computers.  If you have a Windows based system, then you may have more difficulties, simply because the tools for CoreOS have not been all ported to Windows.* The easiest way to started with CoreOS is to run one or more instances inside virtual machines on your local development computer.  This is obviously not the best for performance and certianly shouldn't be used in production, but it does makes it simple to start experimenting with the platform.* Throughout this tutorial series, we're going to make use of several open source tools: * Vagrant for CoreOS Virtual Machine Management * git for downloading code examples * Docker CLI and Daemon for building/testing Docker images * fleetctl, a CLI tool for managing applications deployed in CoreOS * etcdctl, a CLI tool for managing data within the etcd database* Before we can boot our first CoreOS cluster, we need to make sure we have all pre-requisite software installed.  We're going to be using Vagrant with VirtualBox to manage CoreOS virtual machines on our computer.  Vagrant & VirtualBox should work on every major operating system, but please refer to the Vagrant Documentation on using alternative providers like VMWare: https://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/providers/index.html* To get started, please install Vagrant onto your development workstation.  Installation instructions can be found from the vagrantup.com documenation here: https://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/installation/index.html* I have already installed Vagrant on this computer, as I have access to the vagrant command:```vagrant -v```* Another important software package that we'll be using is Git.  All of the code examples we'll be using will be hosted in GitHub* Now we have everything installed that we need to boot our development CoreOS cluster.###	0402 Boot your first cluster* In this section, we are going to launch our first CoreOS development cluster.  * We're going to be following the CoreOS Documetnation for running CoreOS within a Vagrant virtual machine on your development workstation.  You can find the most up-to-date documentation here: https://coreos.com/docs/running-coreos/platforms/vagrant/* If you have Git installed on your computer###	0403 fleetctl & “Hello World” service###	0404 Dockerized service###	0405 Troubleshooting running container###	0406 Toolbox###	0407 etcd & etcdctl
